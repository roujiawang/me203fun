Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, simply PSG, is a professional football club 
in Ligue 1(France). ["The Parisians were founded in 1970, following the merger of Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germain".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.){:target="_blank"} 

In early 2010, Paris Saint-Germain F.C. planned to sell equity and stock to transfer club because there were various operations' problems for a long period. In June 2011, QSI(Qatar Sports Investments) acquired a majority stake of
Paris Saint-Germain F.C., and finally become the only owner in March 2022.

["Qatar Sports Investments (QSi) is a closed shareholding organization founded in 2005 and based in Doha, Qatar"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar_Sports_Investments){:target="_blank"} 

It mainly invests in Qatar's sports and areas of entertainment. The current chairman is  Nasser Al-Khelaifi who is also the president and chief executive officer of Paris Saint-Germain F.C.. 

After acuqiring by Qatar Sports Investments, Paris Saint-Germain F.C. gradually became 
one of the most wealthy clubs in the world and the only state-owned club. Qatar Sports Investments purchased many famous player such as Zlatan Ibrahimović, Edinson Cavani, Ángel Di María, David Beckham, etc. in 2012 to 2016. The Zlatan Ibrahimović is one of my favorite
player. The chinese fans of PSG often called him **"GOD"**. Relevant news reported that ["Ibrahimovic takes PSG into new dimension"](https://www.dawn.com/news/735851/ibrahimovic-takes-psg-into-new-dimension){:target="_blank"}
