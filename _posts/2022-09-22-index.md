# **Western Stars East**
Soccer stars from Europe and South America usually play in those two continents. However, not everyone there is happy; or, some of them may want to try some new life somewhere else. In this way, in recent years, we have seen many familiar faces in the squads of Middle East soccer clubs:
<ul>
  {% for post in site.people %}
    {% if post.tag == 'western-stars-east'%}
      <li>
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{{ post.url }}" target="_blank">{{ post.title }}</a>
      </li>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

# **Eastern Stars West**
Globalization increases the connection of nations, and the talents in the east can now draw attention and receive offers from clubs in the west. Recent years have seen many Middle East soccer players shining in European leagues:

<ul>
  {% for post in site.people %}
    {% if post.tag == 'eastern-stars-west'%}
      <li>
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{{ post.url }}" target="_blank">{{ post.title }}</a>
      </li>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
